## Description

The site that is in "my-portfolio" repository is about me, the author of this site, and it consists of three pages. Home page or About me page is the main page and it can be accessed with the "Pavel Darii" link from the top left corner of the page or from the "About" link that is located also in the nav bar. About me page contains my profile picture, and a general description of my life plus my aspirations; also, in the same container on the bottom are links to my Linkedin and Github accounts. Next page is Portfolio, and there are some images from the last five years of my life. The last page is Contact and can be accessed as well from nav bar, and the access to this page may favor my contact with potential employers and in general with people who want to come with feedback to me.

## Motivation

Main motivation behind this project was to experiment with Bootstrap, which was very helpful in my efficiency. Moreover, for the first time I felt what it means to build a sait from scratch using HTML and CSS, so this experience will be very helpful in the process of learning Javascript. From one to ten on how difficult the project was for me, one being not difficult and ten very difficult , I can give a four.

## Weaknesses of the site

This site is still like a wall that doesn't have anything behind it, and what I mean by this is the lack of functionality; however, the functionality should come together with javascript in future projects.
